# merge-podcast-feeds

A while ago, a friend wondered if I could help them with a
podcast-related issue. They wanted to merge a podcast feed set into a
single, unified RSS feed. One would make the seemingly valid
assumption that there would be a million and one tools out there that
do arbitrary podcast feed manipulation. After all, it's just a bit of
XML. However, multiple minutes of searching Github revealed a meager
set of candidates, none playing well with the standard podcast
formats. And so, here we are.

_merge-podcast-feeds_ does what it says on the tin and nothing
more. It merges a set of podcast feeds into a single RSS feed. You can
do one-shot merges, for those _special occations,_ or have it running
continuously as a live web service. The program supports polling and
basic WebSub and features some oddly specific Castopod integration.

A single JSON configuration file controls the program at
[`resources/json/config.json`](https://github.com/motform/merge-podcast-feeds/blob/main/resources/json/config.json). It validates feed metadata against
[iTunes' required tags](https://help.apple.com/itc/podcasts_connect/#/itcb54353390).
Individual episodes are _not_ validated as they are assumed to
originate from a correct source. Configuration errors are reported, so
check that console!

## Usage

Expects that you have a correctly formatted [`resources/json/config.json`](https://github.com/motform/merge-podcast-feeds/blob/main/resources/json/config.json), see table below for options.

Assuming you have Clojure installed, you can run the command below to check your config generate a single-shot/test .xml.

``` bash
clj -X:test
```

Once you have made sure that everything is working, you can start your server and serve the merged feed.

``` bash
clj -X:server
```

### Config

example. All of these keys are part of the top level `"metadata"`
object.

### Deployment 

The easiest way to deploy _merge-podcast-feeds_ is using Docke and the provided Dockerfile.

You can also build an uberjar manually with:

``` bash
clj -Sdeps '{:mvn/local-repo "./.m2/repository"}' -T:build uber
```

## Development

You can hack away code by opening an nrepl Unix socked using:

``` bash
clj -M:dev
```
